# Design System

- Dark theme first with cohesive palette (see `styles/design-system.css`)
- Reusable components in `components/ui/*` and chat/navigation components
- Principles: Visual consistency, clear hierarchy, interactive states, responsiveness
- Spacing, transitions, utility classes are documented in `DESIGN_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md`

Use design tokens and shared classes to ensure consistency across the app.
